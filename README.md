## Description
The purpose of this challenge was to create a portfolio web page using Bootstrap (4.6) components. The reason behind this is to showcase my work to future employers to show them the skills that I have learnt throughout my time as a Front-End Web Developer. 

The following Bootstrap components were required to develop the porfolio web page (I have provided some examples below):

A Navigation menu:

A Jumbotron:

Bootstrap Cards - Which was used for 'My Work' section:

The web page was also had to minimise media queries. 

## Installation

N/A 

## Usage

The page was to function correctly for example all nav bar links were to link to the specific sections on the page, while all other links were to have a hover effect as per the example below:

The HTML and CSS were to flow accordingly as per the website so that the viewer could understand the layout of the website, I have provided an example below:

HTML example:

Deployed web page flow:

In regards to media queries, these were kept to a minimum but were required for smaller screens, see example below:
